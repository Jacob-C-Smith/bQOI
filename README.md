# bQOI
## **This is a very early release. Please don't use it.**
Blender add-on for writing QOI images.

This add-on exports a QOI images from Blender's image editor. 
NOTE: Do not use the UV Editor. This add-on only works from the image editor.

Unfortunately, these operations take forever to complete, which defeats the purpose of QOI encoding. 

I will optimize this later.
